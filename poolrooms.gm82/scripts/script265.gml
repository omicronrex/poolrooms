/*After numerous explorations, boundless journeys through unquantifiable locations, it seems I have finally reached a place of solitude. Endless halls, long darkly-lit corridors, empty structures of no end; those are what I have become accustomed to. This, however, is my first breathing point in a storm of chaos and confusion — a peaceful point where I can finally rest. Never before have I witnessed architecture such as this; brightly-lit rooms with pools of blue water, surrounding one’s body like a warm embrace. White ceramic tiles make up the walls and floor, reflecting the light and leaving no corner untouched by its radiance.

These places are not bounded in reality — they are a microcosm of one’s mental state, a reflection of their emotions; they are a twisted parody of reality, extended interpretations of locations one does not typically consider whilst passing through. Exploring them can be described as exploring a place inside a dream. They are not infinite, nor are they finite; it is of my belief that these places reflect the headspace of those experiencing them. It is not the doing of any force or overseeing entity whatsoever; instead, it is one’s emotions that keep the rooms extending. There is no architect to these places beside our minds; that is why experiencing these places alone accentuates feelings of isolation. They are human thought pushed away from its makers, alien despite their familiarity. Theoretically, if one were to be completely calm and at peace with their current location, and did not have the inherent desire to escape, they would have the best chance of finding an exit.

I’ve come to call them Scapes. Dreamlike realms one passes through, experiencing and subsequently continuing to the next, like a journey of sorts. One may exit at any time with the right headspace; attaining it, however, is no easy feat whilst running through looping hallways and decrepit offices with nonsensical geometry. While being illogical and foreign, these places are tailored to you. The places you commonly pass through without any thought become all you know. Each Scape is far too familiar, but far too strange to be comforting; it can be compared to a nightmare.

I digress. In short, this Scape in particular truly amazes me. The effect it has on those who experience it is intriguing; while one feels peace and calmness permeating throughout, another cannot help but notice a feeling of dread wash over them as they notice its strange, lightless corners. "What lurks behind them?" they likely wonder. ”Is it of blight, of malice?” A grim scepter seems to wash over the soul, despite the fact that they are safe. An explorer may feel moribund, whilst another may feel tranquil. This strange effect has never ceased to intrigue me. This Scape is without blemish or defect; the “Poolrooms” are simply stunning — an intricate design, a possibly infinite puzzle whose pieces form something peculiar — indescribably strange, yet indescribably perfect; it can only be the handiwork of a God.
