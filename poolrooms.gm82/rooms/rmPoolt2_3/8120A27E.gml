text="These places are not bounded in reality - they are a#microcosm of one's mental state, a reflection of their#emotions; they are a twisted parody of reality, extended#interpretations of locations one does not typically#consider whilst passing through. Exploring them can be#described as exploring a place inside a dream. They are#not infinite, nor are they finite; it is of my belief#that these places reflect the headspace of those#experiencing them. It is not the doing of any force or#overseeing entity whatsoever; instead, it is one's#emotions that keep the rooms extending."
