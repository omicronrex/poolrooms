    ============================
    v1.2.1 - 28 Dec 2023


    A game by renex for the Second Edition of the I Wanna Tourney

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An experimental puzzle game I made based on readings of the Backrooms Wiki.

    I highly recommend playing this game in Fullscreen, with the Smooth
    filtering mode set for the intended experience.
